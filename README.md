1.Introduction
###################################################
This is my term project on "Mobile Phone Shop".
This project is a confirmation of the learned material on the course C++ OOP.
It does not solve any problem, the project is an abstract system that shows the interaction between objects.

2.Instructions
###################################################
--This abstract system demonstrates the basic functions 
 of a cell phone, such as: calling, sending messages(Which are done through the SIM class), recharging, etc.
Objects of the SmartPhone class extend this functionality with features such as:
Calculator, Take Pictures, Get Configuration, etc.

--Also, for more variety, I added a Shop and Citizen class, which is capable of buying a phone and calling other people.

-In my program is implemented bilingual interface (Russian, English)
